		<h1>Stage 1: Branching name query</h1>
		<p>This query creates a series of requests that discover every available name in the catalog in an attempt
		to hit every part of the database and prevent caching. If the catalog has been running then most things will
		be cached anyways. The number of queries starts out at the root and then requests its children, so on and so forth.
		Eventually the number of simultaneous queries will reach the width of the tree and the catalog will slow down as
		seen in the chart below. Mouse over elements to see the number of active elements and the name that caused the delay.

		<h1>Stage 2: Random path query</h1>
		<p>This query creates a huge but consistent burst of queries to random names. The query is requesting the entire
		list of every name under the path provided which varies in size for every request but we only get the first packet.
		The goal here is to stress the catalog with generation of packets and database queries. The catalog should generate
		the full set of packets every time we query it unless it has underlying caching beyond ndn. Below, you can see
		multiple iterations over the same set of names randomly sorted to help ensure the catalog has trouble keeping up.
		</p>

		<p>The following does some simple statistics on the data by first filtering only the query time difference between
		any two neighboring queries to find the average time it takes for a single query to be processed. First, we get the
		absolute value of data[n] - data[n+1] and then run it through simple algorithms to find the min, max, avg, and stdDev.
		The graph below, shows the min, max, avg - stdDev, and avg + stdDev. If you want the exact values, they have been printed
		in console. (Chrome: <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>.)
